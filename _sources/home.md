ICESat-2 Sea Ice Thickness Data Analysis and Visualization
=============================================


### Project description
This book highlights code developed for data analysis and visualization of ICESat-2 monthly gridded sea ice data, along with other relevant datasets. All of the code presented in the notebooks section of this book are configured to run through Google Colab, although you can download the notebooks and run them on your local drive way as well (see the [GitHub](https://github.com/nicolejkeeney/icesat2-book) repo to download the environment used).<br><br>Datasets used in the notebooks were regridded to the ICESat-2 grid and compiled into one dataset, which is loaded in each notebooks. See the data wrangling page for more information on this process. <br><br>To run a notebook, hover over the rocketship icon at the top of the webpage, and click Colab to open the notebook in Google Colab.
